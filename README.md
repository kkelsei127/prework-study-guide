# prework-study-guide

## Description

I wanted to see if I could create a webpage utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is one of my first projects that I will be able to use and referrence later on throughout the course. This helps me to have a good reference point as to what templates and flows should look like all the while being bundled up in a centralized location. This was my first time using JavaScript and I was able to successfully incorporate it into my work.

Additionally with this study guide I am able to open the DevTools console and see the JavaScript is running.
